# CosmoCode
Notes, snippets, links, and slides from CosmoCode meetings. We meet weekly in room 307(?) at Cahill from 1:30pm to 4:30pm to work on and to discuss different software projects.

Most of the content in this repository lives in the [wiki](https://github.com/Darksector326/CosmoCode/wiki/).

# Schedule

We usually start each CosmoCode session with a brief contribution to a software project.
